# Hiring-Process-Analytics
This project aims to carry out the in-depth analysis of major underlying trends about the hiring process.

We are provided with the data records of a company's previous hirings. This dataset has details about people who registered for a particular post in a department of this company. Exploratory Data Analysis was done using excel to draw necessary conclusions about the company. We have been asked to answer certain questions making sense out of that data.

1. How many males and females are hired? (Hiring process of intaking of people into an organization for different kinds of positions.)

2. What is the average salary offered in this company? (Average Salary: Adding all the salaries for a select group of employees and then dividing the sum by the number of employees in the group.)

3. Draw the class intervals for salary in the company. (The class interval is the difference between the upper class limit and the lower class limit.)

4. Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph ( or any other graph ) to show proportion of people working different department. (This is one of the most important part of analysis to visualize the data.)

5. Represent different post tiers using chart/graph. (Use different charts and graphs to perform the task representing the data)
